A recent community event aimed at introducing students to the basics of Python programming language was a great success. The event, held on 25-02-2023, with students eager to learn about Python.

Python is a widely used programming language in many industries, including software development, data science, and artificial intelligence. The event aimed to provide the community with the fundamental knowledge of Python, including its basic syntax, data types, variables and control structures

Moving forward we look to conduct similar events so that the students can get a hold of python programming language moving forward. We also target in teaching the community about various technologies and concepts using python.

In addition to Python programming language, the event also introduced students to two important initiatives - Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and UN Solution Challenge. GSoC is an annual program that encourages university students to participate in open-source software development projects, while the UN Solution Challenge is a global competition that aims to find innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges.

The event was a great opportunity for students to learn about Python programming language, as well as to be introduced to two important initiatives that could help them gain valuable experience and contribute to meaningful projects. The attendees were highly engaged and eager to learn, and they left the event with a newfound understanding and appreciation for the power of Python.

Overall, the event was a great success, and the organizers are thrilled with the turnout and the positive feedback from the attendees. They hope to host more such events in the future to continue promoting and supporting learning and development in the community.
