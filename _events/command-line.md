On January 07, 2022, the Coding Club Hitam conducted a session on command line interface (CLI) for its members. The objective of the session was to teach the basics of CLI and how to use it to perform various tasks efficiently.


## Introduction to CLI

The session started with an introduction to CLI and its importance in software development. The participants were taught about the benefits of using CLI, such as the ability to automate tasks, perform operations more quickly, and access powerful tools and utilities that are not available through graphical user interfaces.

## Basic CLI Commands

The participants were then introduced to the basic CLI commands such as navigating the file system, creating and deleting files and directories, displaying file content, and searching for files. The session focused on the Unix command line interface, which is widely used in software development.

## Best Practices to be used in a Project

In the session the students were given a hands on experience on how to use the file system of your computer while navigating in a project and were also being introduced to the best practice of file usage and system use to minimize the cluter which a project may cause.

It included various ideas of students on how to create files and the best place to store files and manage them such that they can be efficiently accessable on contrary to the general practice which day-to-day users have.

## GSoc and UN Solution Challenge

The students were also being introduced to various prominent competitions to be conducted and which can increase the students skill set if they want to join in. Just a breif abstract was been given to students upon the various competition and various formats.
